### Vector Design Tool - A Microsoft paint spinoff

This is a collaborate project between Bogdan Todor and Jake Sykes, aimed to recreate Microsoft Paint in Java. 
From this project we learnt how to:

* Utilise OOP principles such as polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation to develop an efficient and functional desktop application. 
* Develop unit tests for a desktop application with a GUI component.
* Utilise data structures for various purposes such as: storing user inputs, mouse events, historical actions and system file interactions.
* Handle exceptions specific to the program created.
* Effectively incorporate version control into a group project.
* Effectively work in a team.
